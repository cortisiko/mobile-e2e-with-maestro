Maestro is a newcomer in the mobile testing space, and I wanted to get hands-on experience with it. This repository serves as a place to document my exploration of Maestro for mobile end-to-end testing. My goal is to experiment with its capabilities, understand its strengths and limitations, and share a practical implementation that others can learn from and build upon.


### The Workflow

Download an APK - I'm using an open-source project's APK to ensure anyone can reproduce these tests without licensing issues.
Create an Emulator on GitHub Actions - Instead of relying on local setups, this repo configures testing environments directly in GitHub Actions workflows.
Run the Tests - Execute Maestro tests against the target application in the CI environment.
